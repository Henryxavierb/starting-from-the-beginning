<h1 align="center">Functions</h1>

Functions is a block code that has instructions for execute some statement.
We can use for perform a task, like calculate a math question, or maybe call some API to fetch any data that you need to use on front-end. You have infinite possible cases!

### The function definition consistes:

- A name for the function;
- Parameters that can or not exist. Parameters are separated by commas. Also can be enclosed in curly brackets, { }. This define that you provide an object to function;
- Arguments. An argument is understood as everything that is passed as a parameter when the function is called;

```
function fullName(name, lastname) {
  return "My name is " + name + " " + lastname
}

fullName("John", "Victor");
```

### So, knowing this we have:

<br>

* A function declaration:
```
  function fullName() {...}
```

* A function name:
```
  fullName
```

* A function return:
```
  return "My name is " + name + " " + lastname
```

* The function parameters:
```
  (name, lastname)
```

* The function arguments:
```
  ("John", "Victor")
```

* The function call:
```
  fullName("John", "Victor")
```

* The function scope:
```
       {...}
```
