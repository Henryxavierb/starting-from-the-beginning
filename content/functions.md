<h1 align="center">Functions</h1>

Functions is a block code that has instructions for execute some statement.
We can use for perform a task, like calculate a math question, or maybe call some API to fetch any data that you need to use on front-end. You have infinite possible cases!

A function defination consistes:

- A name for the function;
- Parameters that can or not exist. Parameters are separated by commas. Also can be enclosed in curly brackets, { }. This define that you provide an object to function;

```

function fullName(name, lastname) {
  return "My name is " + name + " " + lastname
}

fullName("John", "Victor");
```

We declared a fullName function that receives a name and last name. After providing these properties are retuned with a string containing a phrase: "My name is John Victor".

OBS: Your function is run only if you call.
